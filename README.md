# Based on Open Source Projects #
- Many open source components are used. A comprehensive list you can find on https://github.com/DustinBrett/daedalOS.

# Experimental #
- This "bare desktop" version does contain little content. Dustins work has lead to a stable and versatile work place. Though the majority of legacy games and programs are not required for work.
- This version is an experimental "core" of deadalOS, meant to stage content from a server.
- The main directory of programs and data should be mapped into a docker container as shown soon in the instructions.
- The image should get updates from daedalOS upstream frequently.
